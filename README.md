Chrome extension used to search and open mongo document accros multile data sets by ObjectID in MongoExpress web interface

## Project abandoned

Bad descisions were made at the beginning of this little project. 

It was thought that plain old javascript will be enouch for just simple tool that has to just "open something" in new tab(s) and any framework is unnecessary overhead, but it soon became obvious that this assumption is wrong.

Also I HATE JavaScript, so I decided to completely rewrite this chrome extension using Angular and typed and more like normal programming language looking TypeScript, so here it goes:
